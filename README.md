# Worker Pools in Go

This project demonstrates the concept of Worker Pools in Go, as illustrated in the Go by Example tutorial.

## Overview

The Worker Pool pattern involves a group of workers (goroutines) that concurrently perform tasks from a job queue.

In this project, we have implemented a simple worker pool with three workers to process a set of jobs.

## Files

- `main.go`: Contains the main function and the logic to initialize workers and jobs.
- `worker.go`: Defines the worker function responsible for processing jobs.
- `README.md`: You're reading it right now! Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Running the Project

To run the project, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go run main.go
```

You should see the output displaying the workers starting and finishing jobs concurrently.

## Conclusion

By implementing a Worker Pool in Go, we can efficiently manage concurrent tasks and utilize resources effectively. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where we need to process a large number of tasks concurrently.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements!
